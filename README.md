The fastest, simplest way to obtain an executable for an off-network forensic workstation is to use the 'build_exe.py'
script in the 'build_exe' folder of this repository. Command: python build_exe.py

A pre-compiled executable has been split into chunks and will be concatenated using this script. Otherwise, please use the spec.spec and pyinstaller.
