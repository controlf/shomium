Building shomium

* The simplest way to build shomium is to build the precompiled executable from /build_exe.

Due to GitHub file size restrictions, the precompiled executable: 'shomium.exe' has been broken into chunks. 

Using the batch script in the /build_exe  directory found in the root of shomium, an executable can be 

generated which concatenates the chunks.

* Otherwise, please install all the required dependencies and use the spec.spec file provided.
